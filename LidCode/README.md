This application counts the speed of the code and the number of code words,
brings the original matrix to a systematic form, calculates code words and information words,
counts the number of errors that the code can find and correct and performs a leader decoding.
Launch main.py, algorithm.py is the program code, ui.py is a graphical interface. Dist directory contains an exe application.

How to work with the program, in the main text field, you need to enter a matrix separated by spaces and enter,
which will contain a single matrix (an example of input is demonstrated when launching the application),
and click enter. in the resulting result, from the first table in the second column,
we take any row and change one value from it (0 to 1 or 1 to 0), press enter and at the bottom we get S, C, i.
S is a syndrome that corresponds to the error vector, C is a corrected row that corresponds to the information word i.
